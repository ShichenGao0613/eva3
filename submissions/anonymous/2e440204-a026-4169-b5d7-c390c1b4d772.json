      "insightA": "The bar chart depicts a distribution of weights, with the highest concentration around the 2,500 weight range, followed by a gradual decline towards higher weight bins.\n\nThe distribution seems skewed to the right, suggesting a larger frequency of lighter weights and fewer instances of higher weights.\n\nThe statistical data shows a mean weight of approximately 3,259, with a standard deviation of 1,011, indicating a diverse range of weights. The median is 3,250, confirming the skew observed in the chart.\n\nBoth the visual and statistical data confirm a right-skewed distribution in weights, with the most common occurrences around the 2,500 range and a gradual decrease as weights increase.\n\nThe data highlights a prevalent pattern where lighter weights are more frequent, peaking around 2,500 and tapering off with heavier categories.",

      "insightB": "The CSV file contains information about weight bins and their corresponding counts. Here’s a summary of the data:\n\n| Weight Bin | Count |\n|------------|-------|\n| 1600       | 2     |\n| 1700       | 5     |\n| 1800       | 8     |\n| 1900       | 23    |\n| 2000       | 15    |\n| ...        | ...   |\n\n### Insights:\n\n- The chart shows the distribution of weight categories with intervals of 1,000.\n- The most frequent category is **2,000–3,000**, which matches the highest point on the histogram, confirming a peak in that range in the CSV data.\n- As weight increases beyond 3,000, there is a decrease in frequency, as depicted in both the graph and the data.\n\nThe histogram and the CSV data jointly illustrate a typical distribution pattern, starting with a low frequency in the lower weights, peaking in the mid-range, and decreasing again in the higher weights.",

This indicates potential stock prioritization based on demand.\n\nThere is a clear skew towards higher counts for general office supplies, while specialized equipment like 'Copiers' sees much less demand. This information could guide inventory management decisions.",

As the number of cylinders increases, there is a noticeable increase in maximum acceleration, particularly for 4 to 8 cylinders.\n\nA visual inspection indicates that vehicles with higher cylinder counts tend to have higher maximum acceleration values.

      "reason": "I feel like I like how Insight A was able to properly aggregate the results of the graph into a numerical table that was very easy to understand. personally, my mind begins to understand and analyze the data a lot faster than when i am reading the insight from B. I think A gives a better starting point to further dive into the data",

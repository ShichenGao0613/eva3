      "insightA": "The chart shows an upward trend in the average production budget from 1996 to 2008, with notable increases around 2003 and a significant rise by 2008.\n\nVisually, the chart suggests a gradual increase in production budgets over the years, with some fluctuations but a generally upward trajectory.\n\nStatistical analysis reveals a mean production budget of approximately $60 million, with a median of about $58 million. The standard deviation is around $12.8 million, indicating moderate variability. The correlation between release year and production budget is approximately 0.72, suggesting a strong positive relationship.\n\nThe visual trends and statistical analysis together indicate a notable increasing trend in production budgets over the examined period, with substantial growth particularly noticeable in the later years.\n\nThere is a strong positive correlation between the release year and the production budget, supported by both the observed upward trend in the chart and the calculated statistical measures.",

      "insightB": "The CSV file contains two columns: \"Release Year\" and \"avg_production_budget\" (the average production budget). The years range from 1996 onwards, with corresponding average budgets in dollars. \n\n### Insights from the Data and Chart\n\n1. **Trend Observation**:\n   - Both the chart and CSV data show a general increase in the average production budget over the years.\n   \n2. **Specific Increases**:\n   - The chart highlights a notable increase after 2008, with the average budget rising significantly.\n\n3. **Budget Summary**:\n   - From the CSV, we see specific values such as \\$45 million in 1996 and \\$58 million in 1997, indicating fluctuations in the early years.\n\nIf you want more detailed insights or specific analyses, feel free to ask!",

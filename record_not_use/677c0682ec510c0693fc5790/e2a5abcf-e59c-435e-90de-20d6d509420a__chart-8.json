      "insightA": "The histogram shows that the majority of movies have running times between 90 and 130 minutes, with a peak in the 100-110 minute range.\n\nThere is a noticeable decline in the number of movies with running times above 130 minutes, and very few movies surpass 160 minutes.\n\nPython analysis reveals a mean running time of approximately 110 minutes and a standard deviation of about 15 minutes, indicating most movies have a similar running time.\n\nThe visual representation aligns with the statistical analysis, confirming most films are concentrated around the average running time of 110 minutes with minimal variations.\n\nMovies predominantly have a running time near 110 minutes, with a significant drop in longer films, consistent with both visual and statistical data.",

      "insightB": "The CSV contains a column called \"Running Time,\" representing the duration of movies.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the distribution of running times to compare it with the histogram.The distribution of movie running times is as follows:\n\n- **60-80 minutes:** 8 movies\n- **80-100 minutes:** 191 movies\n- **100-120 minutes:** 270 movies\n- **120-140 minutes:** 171 movies\n- **140-160 minutes:** 50 movies\n- **160-180 minutes:** 14 movies\n- **180-200 minutes:** 5 movies\n\n### Insights:\n\n- **Most Common Range:** 100-120 minutes, with the highest count of 270 movies.\n- **Least Common Range:** 180-200 minutes, with only 5 movies.\n- The distribution shows a peak in the 100-120 minutes range, which matches the highest bar in your histogram.\n\nLet me know if you need further analysis!",
